Matt, Sarah is the person I told you about in our last meeting. She is a communication consultant in Los Angeles. She guides the organizations to create and deliver internal
communication that helps organizations to achieve department goals. Her email id is sarahmoore@gmail.com. Sarah, Matt Johnson is Founder of IdeaLaunch, a business writing firm 
in Los Angeles. His email id is mattjohnson011@gmail.com. Thinking there is high potential of you two working together, it would be great if you both find time to meet and know
each other. Now I'll let both of you to take from here.
