Martina's Request/Apology Email


//Write one paragraph that includes: //
Dear Carl, good day. I'm sorry that I forgot to attach the documents to my previous email. Now documents are attached. Kindly ask to share my apologies to your bosses and ask 
them to sign the documents, so that I could finalize our business deal. Please send me signed documents as soon as possible, since the deadline for the deal is coming soon.
Thank you in advance for your kind assistance. 
Regards, Debapriya
